# flask-a-judge

## Description
A simple approach to Jutge.org, using Python and Flask.

## Original intention
This project was made to serve as a workshop for Python + Flask, exclusively -- instead, it now grabs little somethings of many worlds, letting one do the research they want about the topic they want.
